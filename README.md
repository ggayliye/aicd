## Overview of the Project
* The goal of this project is to design a very wide-band amplifier, which is widely used in
wireless/RF systems.
* At the heart of this design, there is a differential-input differential-output amplifier,
loaded with 50 fF parasitic capacitance.
* To extend the bandwidth of the amplifier, a passive inductive peaking mechanism can be employed.
* In order to minimize the effect of supply noise on performance of this amplifier, a voltage regulator
will be employed.
* This voltage regulator needs to have a wide-bandwidth and high DC gain in order to
suppress the supply noise.
* A current distribution network can be applied for producing the necessary bias currents for the
regulator circuit and the amplifier.
* Technology: 45nm CMOS, single-well (only n-well available) 
* Simulator: Cadence Virtuoso
